# Arch Linux

So, you researched some alternative OS and came across `Arch`. Whilst there may be a bit of a learning curve
have no fear, it isn't nearly as difficult as people make it out to be. Before you make a decision to
permanently switch your `OS` here's what to expect.

## Why should I use Arch?

`Arch` provides a `DIY` operating system. Out of the box, you get nothing but the absolute basics. It is then
up to you to `configure` and `install` everything. What this gives you is an `OS` specifically tailored to your
needs and your needs alone. You can have it as secure (or insecure) as you like, you can switch `kernels` have
multiple `desktop environments` to switch between, and do everything you can do on any other `OS`.

I will pre-warn, if you want to use this for gaming, I personally, would not recommend it. Whilst you can indeed
get it working with an `NVIDIA` GPU it is a hassle, the third party switching tools don't get updated often,
`NVIDIA` are often behind the curve with updates rolled out by `Arch` on their rolling release model, overall,
you end up gaming less and less because you are busy fixing your GPU drivers. `Arch` also has some optimisation
issues, whilst you can run `Linux` compatible games, and use `wine` to run windows programs, there is a cost,
and the cost is ease-of-use with other technologies (KVMs, Multiple Monitor setups, wireless controllers etc...).
There can also be imaging issues (flickering etc...) with some monitors, along with a performance drop from `Windows`
gaming if you are playing online multiplayer games where `FPS` and smoothness are critical.

So, what can you do instead? if you only care for casual gaming, or none at all, and just want a daily driver then
`Arch` is a great choice. I personally love the control `Arch` gives me, but also the amount I get to learn by using
`Arch`. If you didn't understand how your `OS` and `kernel` interact fully before, spend a bit of time with `Arch`
and you will soon understand more about `UNIX` systems than ever before.

## Recommendations

I know, you are probably eager to dive in. First though, if you have never installed `Arch` before do yourself a
favor and practice in a `Virtual machine` first. I know, this means you'll have to do it twice or more, but still,
the more practice you get the better you'll understand what you are doing exactly. In this guide I will provide
details on setting up a virtual environment to work in, don't worry it's all free.

By first setting up `Arch` in a `VM` you will learn the basics, and if you mess up it is far less a concern
than it is on your live system. Whether you are going to be partitioning a dual-boot on your existing drive,
or simply installing it from scratch as your main `OS`, I'd recommend some practice first.

I'm n ot going to hold your hand too much. I will fill in the blanks where some of the docs are a bit
hazy for first-timers but I presume you are a competent `Windows` or `Mac` user who understands basic `IT`
functions and terms such as installing programs, if not, then you are going to have a bad time with `Arch` and
I suggest you learn the basics via an `OS` like `Windows` or `Ubuntu` first.
