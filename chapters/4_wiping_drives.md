Here‚Äôs a clean, step-by-step **Markdown guide** you can keep alongside your Arch notes. It focuses only on **wiping drives safely** during Arch installation.

# üî• Wiping Drives in Arch Linux Installer

This guide explains how to identify and wipe drives before partitioning in the Arch Linux installation environment. Use with caution ‚Äî all data on the selected drives will be **irreversibly destroyed**.

---

## 1. Boot into the Arch ISO

Insert your USB medium and boot into the Arch ISO. You should arrive at a root shell.

Update package databases (optional but good practice):

```bash
pacman -Sy
```

---

## 2. Identify Drives

List all block devices:

```bash
lsblk
```

Typical examples:

* `/dev/nvme0n1` ‚Üí Main NVMe SSD
* `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb` ‚Üí SATA SSDs or HDDs
* `/dev/sdc` ‚Üí USB installer (‚ö†Ô∏è **do not wipe this**)

Use `lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT` to confirm which drive is which.

---

## 3. Unmount Drives

If any partitions are mounted, unmount them:

```bash
umount -R /dev/sdX*
umount -R /dev/nvme0n1p*
```

Replace `sdX` / `nvme0n1` with the target device.

---

## 4. Wipe Filesystem Signatures

This removes existing filesystem and partition table signatures:

```bash
wipefs -a /dev/sdX
```

For NVMe drives:

```bash
wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1
```

---

## 5. Optional: Full Zero-Fill (Secure Wipe)

If you want to fully overwrite the drive (slower but more secure):

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This can take hours on large drives. Usually unnecessary unless security is a concern.

---

## 6. Create Fresh Partitions

Once wiped, create new partitions with `cfdisk` or `fdisk`:

```bash
cfdisk /dev/sdX
```

Recommended minimum layout:

* **EFI system partition** ‚Üí 512M, type `EFI System`
* **Root** (`/`) ‚Üí rest of the SSD (Btrfs, ext4, etc.)
* **Optional Home/Data partitions** on other drives

---

## 7. Format Partitions

Examples:

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdX1       # EFI
mkfs.btrfs -L root /dev/sdX2  # Root
mkfs.btrfs -L home /dev/sdY1  # Home on second drive
```

---

## 8. Verify Clean Start

Recheck with:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

You should only see the new filesystems you just created.

---

## Notes

* **Do not wipe your USB installer drive.** Confirm with `lsblk` before wiping.
* Wiping only needs to be done **once** ‚Äî after this, you can focus on mounting and installing Arch.
* If using Btrfs, you can create subvolumes for `@`, `@home`, `@snapshots`, etc. after formatting.

---

‚öñÔ∏è *Reminder:* Wiping is destructive. Take a moment before you press enter: *‚ÄúIs this the correct drive?‚Äù* A Stoic accepts consequences calmly, but a wise Stoic avoids unnecessary mistakes.

Would you like me to extend this into a **full Arch install guide** with Btrfs subvolumes (root, home, snapshots) and EFI setup, so you can go from wiped drive straight into a working Arch in one pass?
